## Files
The repository includes 84 files, each containing verse similarity data for one of the languages listed above. These files are named according to the language code (e.g., `similarity_ar.txt` for Arabic, `similarity_en.txt` for English) and include information about the similarities between Quranic verses as analyzed in that language.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide insight into how Quranic verses relate semantically across different languages, facilitating deeper understanding and research into the meanings conveyed in translations. This can help assess translation consistency and aid in multilingual religious studies.

## Usage
These files can be used for:
- Comparative language analysis
- Religious studies research
- Machine translation evaluation
- Cross-linguistic semantic analysis

For each file, verse similarities are represented in a format that aligns with text similarity metrics, ensuring clarity and readability.
